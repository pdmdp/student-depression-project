# Student Depression Classification – Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a machine learning project developed as part of the *Machine Learning Module 1 (2024/2025)* for the **Bachelor in Artificial Intelligence** at the **University of Pavia (UNIPV)**. The objective is to build a binary classification model capable of predicting whether a student is experiencing depression, based on various lifestyle, demographic, academic, and psychological indicators.

## 📘 Project Overview

- **Problem Statement**: Classify students as either *depressed (1)* or *not depressed (0)* based on personal, academic, lifestyle, and mental health-related features.
- **Dataset**: [Student Depression Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hopesb/student-depression-dataset)
- **Target Variable**: `Depression` (binary: `0` = No, `1` = Yes)
- **Approach**: 
  - Simulate real-world data imperfections by introducing controlled missing values
  - Preprocess data, handle missingness, and apply various classification models
  - Evaluate performance using appropriate metrics
